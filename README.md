# SmallShops
This app will allow small shop owners to list their shops in the app by filling basic information about their business, what they sell and upload photos of the owner, the person who is currently selling at a shop and the products that are in stock. The owner has to register his small phone from the shop itself so the location of the shop can be taken from their smartphone. The availability of stock feature will be integrated with a POS system which will be available for small businesses to use to manage their stock and sales. The app will also allow a regular customer to place an order from their app if what they need to buy from a shop has to be cooked. In addition to the information about the business the user will be able to view the location of the shop from a map in relation to their location.
